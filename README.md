# ADMM_2


This is a project that I wrote for application of Google Summer of CODE. However, due to my carelessness, I forget the deadline and fail to submit my project. Just keep it at my Github site.

This is what I do:

1.Implement L1-penalized Poisson (log-linear) regression in portable, standard C++ using an ADMM algorithm from scratch (not using an existing library)  
2.Wrap their implementation using Rcpp;  
3.Test their implementation;  
4.Package their implementation and pass R CMD check at MacOS and Windows platform.  

Reades can down load that using command 'r install_github("Locher0107/ADMM_LASSO")'
